# Qualities Module

## Overview

This module contains a curated subset of quality-related terms harvested from [PATO](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html). The extracted subclass hierarchy is aligned under [BFO:Quality](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000019) and categorizes qualities into major groups such as biological, chemical, physical, and performance qualities. In particular, it emphasizes morphological qualities by including many mechanical quality terms and reusing core PATO concepts such as size, shape, texture, structure, color, odor, and spatial pattern. The module also incorporates organismal and cellular qualities as subclasses of biological quality.

Additionally, this module features German translations of the quality terms. The initial translations for 856 terms were generated using the text-davinci-003 model and have been further revised manually, bringing the current total to 991 terms with 857 core PATO terms referenced.

## Module Metrics

- **Total Quality Terms Harvested:**  
  - *Core Terms Referenced from PATO:* 857  
  - *Total Terms After Revision & Translation:* 991

- **Major Quality Categories:**  
  - **Biological Quality:** Includes organismal and cellular qualities.  
  - **Chemical Quality:** Encompasses qualities related to chemical properties.  
  - **Physical Quality:** Captures physical properties and measurements.  
  - **Performance Quality:** Focuses on qualities that measure performance aspects.
  - **Morphological Quality:** Enriched with many mechanical qualities and reuse of key PATO concepts (size, shape, texture, structure, color, odor, spatial pattern).

- **Translation Information:**  
  - German translations are provided for all quality terms using an initial AI-generated output (text-davinci-003) followed by manual revisions.

## Source and Provenance

- **Primary Source Ontology:**  
  [PATO (Phenotype And Trait Ontology)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html)

- **Alignment:**  
  The harvested qualities are organized as a subclass hierarchy under [BFO:Quality](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000019).

- **Imported Annotations:**  
  Quality terms include references marked with [Imported From](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/IAO_0000412).

## Usage

This module is designed to be incorporated into ontology projects where quality attributes play a role. It serves as a reference for:
- Assigning quality attributes in biological, chemical, physical, and performance contexts.
- Enriching morphological data with standardized measures (e.g., size, shape, texture).
- Supporting multilingual applications via provided German translations.
