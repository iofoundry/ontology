# Qualities Module

## Overview

This module contains a curated subset of quality-related terms harvested from [PATO](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html). The extracted subclass hierarchy is aligned under [BFO:Quality](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000019) and categorizes qualities into major groups such as biological, chemical, physical, and performance qualities. In particular, it emphasizes morphological qualities by including many mechanical quality terms and reusing core PATO concepts such as size, shape, texture, structure, color, odor, and spatial pattern. The module also incorporates organismal and cellular qualities as subclasses of biological quality.

**Translation Information:**
Additionally, this module features German translations for all terms. Initially created using an AI-generated output (text-davinci-003) followed by manual revisions.

## Metrics

Metrics on the ontology modules can be found in the [Metrics Report](./report.md)

## Source and Provenance

- **Primary Source Ontology:**  
  [PATO (Phenotype And Trait Ontology)](https://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html)

- **Alignment:**  
  The harvested qualities are organized as a subclass hierarchy under [BFO:Quality](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000019).

- **Imported Annotations:**  
  Quality terms include references marked with [adaptedFrom](https://spec.industrialontologies.org/ontology/core/meta/AnnotationVocabulary/adaptedFrom).

## Usage

This module is designed to be incorporated into ontology projects where quality attributes play a role. It serves as a reference for:
- Assigning quality attributes in biological, chemical, physical, and performance contexts.
- Enriching morphological data with standardized measures (e.g., size, shape, texture).
- Supporting multilingual applications via provided German translations.
