# manufacturingProcessDesignOptimization
This repository is intended to show the progress and examples of a Manufacturing Process Design Optimization ontology

The MPDOOntology.ttl (and .rdf) is the current version of the ontology.  It imports the following ontologies:
- the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO)
- the Industrial Ontologies Foundry (IOF)
- the IOF Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Ontologies, namely Equipment, Manufacturing Execution, Material, Monitoring & Control, Parameter, Physical and Recipe modules.

With these imports, the MPDO Ontology utilizes the Recipes and Manufacturing Execution modules, along with Material, to describe biological methods for producing Acetic Acid with Bacteria.

These files and this README will be updated as extensions to the ontology are performed.
