# Supply Chain Reference Ontology (SCRO)

Version 1 Beta, 2022-11-18

*The IOF is an international standards group that operates under the auspices of the Open Applications Group.*

# Introduction 

Supply Chain Reference Ontology (SCRO) aims to represent the generic constructs (including classes and properties) related to the domain of supply chain and logistics. SCRO uses BFO as the top-level ontology and IOF Core as the mid-level ontology. The purpose of the ontology is to serve as a foundation for ensuring consistency and interoperability across various supply chain and logistics ontologies that use IOF reference ontolgies. The Supply Chain Reference Ontology can be extended to create application ontologies addressing the needs of specific use cases.The developmen of SCRO was initially motivated by use cases related to supplier discovery (i.e., supplier capability matching with manufacturing requirements), logistics,  and supply chain traceability. The definitions of the domain terms are extracted from widely acceoted industry standards such as GS! and APICS. 
 

SCRO.owl imports IOF Core directly. BFO-2020.owl and IOF-AnnotationVocabulary.rdf are imported through IOF Core.

## Glossary of Terms
[The glossary](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/InfoneerTXST/Glossary/blob/master/index.html) provides the natural language definitions of SCRO classes and properties

## Example RDF Dataset
This dataset represents a hypothetical supply chain as depicted in [this image](https://github.com/iofoundry/ontology/blob/master/supplychain/Documentation%20&%20Resources/Terms-Patterns-Modules/Ford%20Supply%20Chain.md). The RDF dataset demonstrates how the class "Supply Chain Relationship' is used to represent the strucrue of a supply chain.

## Current Outstanding Issues
- Classifers are excluded from the first release. The plan is to reuse the identifer/classifers patterns provided by Commons Ontologies. However, since their adoption requires some architectural decisions at the core level, this release only includes a few classes related to identifiers. 
- Representation of various states of a shipment (delayed, delivered, etc) requires some temporal interval properties (based Allen's Inverval Algebra) which are currently missing. 
- The base ontology is large and can be split into several smaller ontologies. Once the geeral approach for using 'sub-topics' in IOF is further formalized, the based ontology will be re-architectured.
