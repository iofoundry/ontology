# Materials Module

## Overview

The IOF Materials Ontology aims to represent the generic constructs (including classes and properties) related to the domain of material science and engineering. The Materials Ontology uses BFO as the top-level ontology and IOF Core as the mid-level ontology. The purpose of the ontology is to serve as a foundation for ensuring consistency and interoperability across various material science and engineering ontologies that use IOF reference ontologies.

**Translation Information:**
Additionally, this module features German translations for all terms.

## Metrics

Metrics on the ontology modules can be found in the [Metrics Report](./report.md)

## Usage

This module is designed to be incorporated into ontology projects where determination of material properties or structure attributes play a role. It serves as a reference for:
- Describing Material Science and Engineering procedures and results.
- Cross-referencing of Plan Specifications and Naming Conventions covered in standards.
- Supporting multilingual applications via provided German translations.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve term curation, translation quality, or alignment with source ontologies are welcome. Please submit pull requests or open issues on the repository.
